<h1>So what is this about?</h1>
<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of
<abbr>CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire,
and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the
existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will
load the style sheet into this very page. The
<abbr>HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that
has changed is the external <abbr>CSS</abbr> file. Yes,
really.</p>
