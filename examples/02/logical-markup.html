<h1>So what is this about?</h1>
<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <span

excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin,
view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking
on any one will load the style sheet into this very page.
The <span class="acronym">HTML</span> remains the same,
the only thing that has changed is the external <span
class="acronym">CSS</span> file. Yes, really.</p>
