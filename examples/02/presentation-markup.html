  There is a continuing need to show the power of <i>CSS</i>.
  The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
  participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in
  the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into
  this very page. The <i>HTML</i> remains the same, the only
  thing that has changed is the external <i>CSS</i> file. Yes,
  really.
