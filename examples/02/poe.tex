% The document
\title{The Cask of Amontillado}
\author{Edgar Allen Poe}
\chapter The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne
as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed
revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul,
will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a
threat. {\it At length} I would be avenged; this was a
point definitely settled---but the very definitiveness
with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I
must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is
unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It
is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make
himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\bye
