With the advent of the digital age, typesetting has become available to
virtually anyone equipped with a personal computer. Beautiful text documents can
now be crafted using free and consumer-grade software, which often obviates the
need for the involvement of a professional designer and typesetter. The level
playing field of the Internet coupled with the rising popularity of digital-only
documents then allows the author to bypass the publisher as well, if they so
wish, without jeopardizing their chance of recognition.

This aim of this book is to provide a general overview of the tools and
techniques tied with writing, designing, typesetting, and distributing text
documents---one of the principal means of knowledge preservation and transfer
known to man. Each chapter describes one discrete step of document preparation
along with practical examples and references to literature for those interested
in further study of the subject matter.

The chapter are filled with examples that illustrate the subject matter. These
should be consulted whenever the concepts described in the text are unclear to
the reader. Although care was taken not to favor any computing environment,
some examples feature Unix utilities that may or may not have a suitable
counterpart in operating systems such as Windows. To try these examples out, the
reader is advised to install a Unix-like environment---such as the Windows
Cygwin---on their local machine.
