    \chapter{Foreword}
      With the advent of the digital age, typesetting has become available to
      virtually anyone equipped with a personal computer. Beautiful documents
      can now be crafted using free and consumer-grade software, which often
      obviates the need for the involvement of a professional designer and
      typesetter. The level playing field of the Internet coupled with the
      rising popularity of digital-only documents then allows the aspiring
      author to bypass the publisher as well, if they so wish, without
      jeopardizing their chance of recognition.
      
      This text is intended as a handbook for any author who aspires to write,
      design, typeset and distribute high-quality documents of their own making.
      Each chapters describes one discrete step in the process of the creation
      of a document and their order corresponds to the realities of document
      preparation, allowing the author to break the process down to manageable
      parts and tackle each of them separately. This also allows for the
      separation of labour, where each part of the process can be completed
      independently by a different specialist. However, a lone author who is
      preparing a less complex document or who feels confident in their ability
      to multitask may find it more productive to interleave several steps of
      the document preparation process.

    \chapter{Markup}
      A manuscript can consist of a seamless river of words and still make
      perfect sense to the author. To truly capture its meaning in a clear and
      unambiguous manner, however, the manuscript will often need to be
      supplemented with a set of annotations. At a more basic level, this refers
      to the compliance with the orthographic rules, such as the correct
      spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks and punctuation, that
      are specific to the language of the document. It is not unreasonable to
      expect that this basic compliance should be already met by the manuscript.
      At a higher level, this consists of discovering and marking up the inner
      order and the logic of the text, so that the resulting document can later
      be typeset in a way that visually reflects the structure of the text.
      
      To this end, there exists a wealth of \emph{markup languages} that enable
      the enrichment of text with additional information and labels. Aside from
      \emph{logical markup}, which enables the capture of the logical structure
      of the document, markup languages may also provide \emph{presentation
      markup}, which directly impacts the visual properties of the document, but
      which carries no semantic information. The usage of presentation markup
      instead of logical markup makes it impossible to separate the markup from
      the design of the document and to capture the logic of the text. As a
      result, the unity of the design of each logical part of the document would
      have to be ensured manually and future changes of design would become
      tedious. It is for these reasons that the usage of presentation markup is
      discouraged in favour of logical markup.

      \section{Meta Markup Languages}
      \subsection{The General Markup Language}
        As described in \cite{hlava11}, the situation engulfing digital
        typesetting was growing increasingly frustrating for publishers in the
        1960s. The markup languages used by different typesetting systems varied
        wildly and once a publisher had a large collection of documents typeset
        via a given company, switching to another one could be very costly. The
        companies would often take advantage of this situation, causing their
        prices to skyrocket. As a result of that, a demand for a universal
        markup language emerged.

        This demand was met by a side product of a project developed\footnote{
          More information about the project can be found within the personal
          recollections of its co-author, Charles F. Goldfarb, in
          \cite{goldfarb96} and \cite{goldfarb97:whySGML}.
        } at the \acronym{IBM}'s Cambridge Scientific Center in the early 1970s.
        The project aimed at imbuing a text editor with the ability to query,
        edit and display documents from a repository to allow the usage of
        computers in legal practice. Very early on in the development process,
        it became clear that the crux was going to be the markup languages in
        which the documents were written. These languages were not unified and
        many of them comprised largely presentation markup, which made
        information retrieval impossible without the use of heuristics. To
        resolve the issue, a unifying markup language called the General Markup
        Language (\acronym{GML}) was drafted as a solution to the decribed
        problem. The language was later released to the public in
        \cite{goldfarb81} and finally standardized\footnote{
          The authoritative resource on the \acronym{SGML} language is
          \cite{goldfarb91}, which includes the full text of the standard along
          with the author's extensive annotations.
        } as the Standard General Markup Language (\acronym{SGML}) within
        \cite{iso8879}.

        \acronym{SGML} documents consist of text mixed with \emph{tags}, which
        delimit meaningful sections of the document called \emph{elements}.
        Elements can carry additional information in \emph{attributes}. A
        \acronym{SGML} document can also contain miscellaneous processing
        instructions for the application as well as human-readable comments.
        Repeated strings of text can be declared as \emph{entities} that can
        consequently be used throughout the document in place of the original
        strings.
        
        Although the described structure is shared by all \acronym{SGML}
        documents, the actual syntax, as well as the restrictions with regards
        to the contents and the attributes of individual elements, are declared
        within a Document Type Declaration (\acronym{DTD}), which can be
        different for each document. It is worth noting that a \acronym{DTD}
        only declares the syntax of an \acronym{SGML} document and the semantics
        of the individual elements and their attributes are left to the
        interpretation of the program processing the document. The syntax and
        the constraints imposed by a \acronym{DTD} define an \emph{application}
        of \acronym{SGML}. An \acronym{SGML} document is considered to be a
        valid instance of an \acronym{SGML} application, when it conforms to the
        respective \acronym{DTD}.

      \subsection{The Extensible Markup Language}
        Although \acronym{SGML} was designed to be the general format for data
        exchange, the complexity of the specification and the lack of support
        for Unicode proved to be a major hinderance preventing its wider
        adoption and tool development. As a response, the World Wide Web
        Consortium (W3C) published a specification of the Extensible Markup
        Language (\acronym{XML}) within \cite{bray98} in 1998. Along with the
        introduction of \acronym{XML}, the \acronym{SGML} specification received
        a technical corrigendum of \cite{goldfarb97:webSGML}, which turned
        \acronym{XML} into a proper subset of \acronym{SGML} restrained by an
        \acronym{SGML} \acronym{DTD}.
        
        %%% A brief SGML tutorial <http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970708/intro/sgmltut.html>
        %%% Comparison of SGML and XML <http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-sgml-xml>
        
        This \acronym{DTD} completely fixes the syntax of \acronym{XML}
        documents, which makes it possible to differentiate two levels of
        correctness. Specifically, an \acronym{XML} document is considered to be
        \emph{well-formed}, when it conforms to the \acronym{SGML} \acronym{DTD}
        that defines \acronym{XML}. An \acronym{XML} document is considered to
        be \emph{valid} with regards to an \acronym{XML} \acronym{DTD}, when it
        is well-formed and conforms to the said \acronym{XML} \acronym{DTD}.
        Along with \acronym{DTD}s, there exists a wealth of \emph{schema}
        languages for \acronym{XML}, such as \acronym{W3C XML} Schema, Regular
        Language for \acronym{XML} Next Generation (\acronym{Relax NG}) or
        Schematron that can be used to check the validity of an \acronym{XML}
        document instead of a \acronym{DTD}. The constrains imposed by either a
        \acronym{DTD} or a schema define an \emph{application}, \emph{language}
        or \emph{format} of \acronym{XML}.

          % Examples of various XML schema languages and DTD
          % Examples of validity testing
        
        Along with schema languages, other languages supplementary languages
        also exist, such as XPointer, XPath and XQuery for addressing sets of
        elements (fragments) within a \acronym{XML} document or Cascading Style
        Sheet language (\acronym{CSS}) for specifying the visual properties of a
        \acronym{XML} document. While some of these languages may not be
        \acronym{XML} languages, they are nevertheless linked to and used within
        documents of various \acronym{XML} formats and form an important part of
        the \acronym{XML} ecosystem.

        Due to the reduced complexity of \acronym{XML} compared to
        \acronym{SGML}, the language was adopted by specialists and the general
        public alike and has superseded \acronym{SGML} in many applications.
        Some of the applications of \acronym{XML} for document
        preparation include DocBook\footnote{
          The authoritative resource on the DocBook \acronym{XML} format is
          \cite{walsh10}. The book itself is written in DocBook and its source
          code is publicly available at the Web page at
          \url{http://docbook.org}.
        }---a technical documentation format used for authoring books by
        publishers such as O'Reilly Media and for documenting software at
        companies such as Red Hat, \acronym{SUSE} or Sun Microsystems---,
        Text Encoding Initiative (\acronym{TEI})---a general text encoding
        format for the use in the academic field of digital humanities---,
        or Mathematical Markup Language (\acronym{MathML})---a format for
        describing mathematical formulae. Other \acronym{XML} applications, such
        as \acronym{XHTML} and \acronym{RDF/XML}, will be described in Section
        \ref{sec:www-markup}.
        
      \section{Markup on the World Wide Web}\label{sec:www-markup}
      \subsection{The Hypertext Markup Language}
        In 1989, Timothy John Berners-Lee proposed in \cite{bernerslee89} a
        decentralized system for sharing linked documents within \acronym{CERN}.
        The system laid foundation for today's World Wide Web (Web) and earned
        its author knighthood. The markup language used to write documents for
        the system was an application of \acronym{SGML} called the HyperText
        Markup Language (\acronym{HTML}). In 1993, the Web started to gain
        popularity amongst the general public due to the release of the first
        graphical Web browser Mosaic, which paved way for the Web browsers of
        today. In 1994, Timothy John Berners-Lee formed the World Wide Web
        Consortium (\acronym{W3C}), which has since been developing the
        standards for the Web.

        %%% On the various meanings of <tag /> <https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ShortTagsMeanings>

        The first standard version of \acronym{HTML} was published as
        \cite{rfc1866} in 1995. As the Web was becoming ubiquitous, it began
        accumulating an increasing number of documents that weren't valid
        instances of \acronym{HTML}, since most Web browsers, when faced with a
        malformed document, would act in accordance with the Postel's law and
        try to render the document despite its deficiencies. In an attempt to
        unify the way malformed \acronym{HTML} documents were rendered across
        the Web browsers, \acronym{W3C} standardized this behaviour as a part of
        \cite{berjon14} in 2014. As a result, the current version of
        \acronym{HTML} is no longer strictly an application of \acronym{SGML}.

          % Example of a valid HTML5 document that is an invalid SGML
          % application instance (overlapping tags)

        Initially, \acronym{HTML} comprised a mixture of logical and
        presentation markup with fixed visual interpretation. In 1996 a
        specification of a Cascading Style Sheet (\acronym{CSS}) language was
        published by \acronym{W3C} within \cite{lie96}. The language enabled
        the specification of the visual properties of any element, which allowed
        for the separation of document markup and design, effectively
        eliminating the need for the presentation markup.

          % Example of the usage of CSS in favour of presentation markup

        During the same period, an initial version of a scripting language
        called JavaScript was drafted and incorporated into Netscape Navigator
        2.0, one of the contemporary leading web browsers. As a part of a
        joint effort to bring Java into web browsers by Sun Microsystems and
        Netscape Communications, JavaScript was supposed (see
        \cite{js-announcement}) to complement Java applets -- a role it has
        since outgrown. Standardized within \cite{ecma1} in 1997, JavaScript
        blurs the line between static documents and interactive applications and
        remains the predominant client-side programming language for the Web.
        However, since the support of JavaScript by a Web browser is fully
        optional, it is considered a good practice to use it chiefly for the
        enrichment of an already self-sufficient \acronym{HTML} document. In
        case of an interactive application, this recommendation can be relaxed.

      \subsection{Linked Data and Microdata}
        % (v) Not the primary function of linked data, though
        The primary fundament of the Web was the idea of links forming edges
        between documents. The exponential growth of data present on the Web
        propelled the evolution of search engines, which try their best to
        return relevant documents to a given search query. To overcome the
        limitations in the analysis of documents primarily intended to be read
        by humans rather than machines, a proposal was made by ???  to create
        additional mark-up, which would imbue links with additional information
        regarding the relationship between the documents and which would add
        machine-friendly structured information to a document.
