\chapter{Typesetting}
\iffalse % This text is completely temporary
After finishing the design, the marked up manuscript can be flowed into the
document and checked for typesetting errors. Some of the more common typesetting
errors include \termpl{widow} and \termpl{orphan}---runt lines that are left
separated from the rest of the paragraph---, overfull lines, and improper line
breaks. In book design, only the actual errors found in the typeset document
need to be addressed. In web design, typographic errors need to be fixed
pre-emptively, as the document may display differently on various devices.
